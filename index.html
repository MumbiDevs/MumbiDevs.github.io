							<span class="byline">My Journey to Maze Quest – Why I Chose to Build a 2D Maze Game</span>
						</header>
						
						<p>I’ve always had a love for puzzles and games that make you think. Growing up, I was the kid who couldn’t resist a challenge—whether it was solving a Rubik's cube or figuring out how to beat the next level of a game. But mazes? Mazes were my absolute favorite. There was something about getting lost in a labyrinth, slowly piecing together the path forward, that felt both thrilling and satisfying.</p>
					
						<p>As I got older and started working as a developer, that love for mazes never left me. In fact, it was my go-to when I needed to clear my head—sitting down with a pen and paper to draw out mazes for myself or friends to solve. It wasn’t just about getting from point A to point B; it was about the journey, the missteps, and the sense of achievement when you finally found the right path.</p>
						<p>As I got older and started working as a developer, that love for mazes never left me. In fact, it was my go-to when I needed to clear my head—sitting down with a pen and paper to draw out mazes for myself or friends to solve. It wasn’t just about getting from point A to point B; it was about the journey, the missteps, and the sense of achievement when you finally found the right path.</p>
						<p>This passion is what inspired Maze Quest. I wanted to build something that captures that excitement I felt as a kid, but in a way that others could experience too. The idea of combining my love for game design with my love for mazes seemed like the perfect project. And, of course, the 2D format allowed me to start small, focusing on the gameplay mechanics and the puzzle elements before diving into anything too complex.</p>
						<p>The process of creating Maze Quest has been both fun and challenging—just like the mazes I used to draw. It’s allowed me to merge creativity and logic, experimenting with different maze layouts, traps, and treasures. Every maze is a new challenge, not just for the player but for me as a designer. And that’s the beauty of it.</p>

							<p>Ultimately, I chose to work on this 2D maze project because it feels like a return to something that I’ve always loved. But more importantly, it’s an opportunity to share that love with others—to give players the same sense of wonder and accomplishment that I’ve always found in mazes.</p>

			<h2>Completed Features in Maze Quest</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="4u">
					<h2>Maze Generation and Dynamic Layouts</h2>
					<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/back3.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>One of the core features completed in Maze Quest is the maze generation system. Players are presented with unique, hand-crafted mazes that vary in difficulty, encouraging exploration and problem-solving. The dynamic layouts ensure that no two mazes feel identical, which keeps the gameplay fresh and challenging. This feature gives players new mazes to solve as they progress, providing increasing complexity as they advance through the game.</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="4u">
					<h2>Treasure Collection and Traps</h2>
					<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/back4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The treasure collection system is a key gameplay mechanic where players must navigate through the maze to find and collect hidden treasures. However, scattered throughout the mazes are traps that the player must avoid. Stepping on a trap results in a setback, such as losing treasures or restarting from a previous point. This feature adds layers of strategy, forcing players to weigh risks and rewards as they explore.</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="4u">
					<h2>Smooth Player Movement and Collision Detection</h2>
					<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/back5.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Player movement in Maze Quest is fluid and responsive, allowing for smooth navigation through the maze. This feature includes robust collision detection, ensuring that the player’s character accurately interacts with walls, treasures, and traps within the maze. Players can intuitively control their movements while avoiding obstacles, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>

				<span class="byline">Technologies Used in Maze Quest and Why We Chose Them</span>
			</header>
			<li>Godot Game Engine</li>
			<p>We chose the Godot Engine as the core framework for building Maze Quest. Godot offers an intuitive interface and a powerful set of tools for 2D game development, making it the ideal choice for this project. It allows for rapid prototyping, and its node-based system made it easy to structure our mazes, traps, and player mechanics. Additionally, Godot’s scripting language, GDScript, is highly flexible and similar to Python, which made it easier to iterate quickly during development.
Another reason for choosing Godot was its lightweight design and open-source nature, meaning we weren’t tied down by heavy licensing fees or bloated tools. The engine’s strong support for both 2D and 3D game development also provides future flexibility, should we decide to expand Maze Quest</p>
		<li>GDScript</li>
			<p>We opted to use GDScript for all the core game logic. GDScript is tightly integrated with Godot, allowing us to manage player controls, maze generation, and interactions with traps and treasures seamlessly. It’s easy to pick up, readable, and efficient for small projects like Maze Quest. The ability to directly interact with the engine’s scene and node structure through GDScript was a major reason for choosing it, as it made scripting gameplay mechanics straightforward.</p>

			<li>Godot’s Animation System</li>
			<p>For player movement and interactions, we utilized Godot’s animation system. This system made it easy to implement smooth transitions, whether it was the player moving through the maze or triggering traps. Its simplicity allowed us to focus on core gameplay without getting bogged down by overly complex animation pipelines.</p>

			<li>Tilemaps</li>
			<p>To design the mazes in Maze Quest, we relied on Godot’s built-in Tilemap system. This feature allowed us to easily create complex mazes by placing predefined tiles that represent walls, pathways, traps, and treasures. Tilemaps offer the flexibility we needed for creating dynamic mazes without writing extensive code for manual level design, saving us development time while still offering the ability to create visually distinct and varied mazes.</p>

						<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/back4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<p>As someone who loves the thrill of discovery, I wanted to ensure Maze Quest inspired a similar feeling of adventure. My focus was on making the mazes feel like more than just puzzles—they should feel like worlds to explore, with hidden treasures, traps, and surprises around every corner. It was important to me that players would want to explore every inch of the maze, searching for secrets and rewards along the way.</p>
						
					</div>
					<div class="4u">
						<h2>The Purpose Behind Creating MazeQuest</h2>
						<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/back5.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>The purpose of creating Maze Quest is to blend entertainment, cognitive development, and creative design into one cohesive game. It's not just about reaching the end of a maze—it's about the journey, the challenges, and the small victories along the way. The simplicity of the concept also makes it a great space to experiment with storytelling and creative mechanics.</p>

						<span class="byline">Difficult technical challenges I encountered</span>
					</header>
					
					<p>One of the most difficult technical challenges I encountered while developing Maze Quest involved implementing dynamic collision detection between the player, the walls of the maze, and in-game objects like treasures and traps. Early in development, I realized that without accurate collision detection, the player could walk through walls, miss traps entirely, and collect treasures without actually interacting with them. This issue undermined the entire gameplay experience, as it made navigating the maze trivial and broke the core mechanics of the game.</p>

						<p>The task was to design a system that could reliably detect when the player collided with a wall or object, providing immediate feedback such as stopping the player's movement or triggering a trap. To make this work, I needed to leverage Godot’s physics engine and its collision detection capabilities, but I hadn’t worked much with Godot’s Tilemap system before, which added complexity. The maze walls were drawn using tiles, and I had to configure the collision shapes of each tile correctly, making sure that player interactions would register smoothly.</p>
						
						<p>After some research, I mapped out how to use Godot’s built-in collision nodes, attaching them to the player and tiles. I tested the system, but I quickly ran into performance issues. The player would either get stuck when they shouldn’t or pass through walls, especially at the corners of tiles where collisions seemed inconsistent.</p>
						
						<p>To address this, I implemented a more efficient approach. I fine-tuned the collision shapes and reduced the precision to make calculations simpler while keeping the interactions accurate. I also added raycasting to detect player proximity to traps and treasures. After multiple iterations and debugging, the system finally worked as intended. The result was smooth, reliable player movement that interacted with maze elements as expected, which improved the game’s overall playability dramatically. This challenge taught me the importance of balancing accuracy and performance in collision detection, especially in puzzle-based games like Maze Quest.</p>

							<h2>Technical Takeaways</h2>
							<p>One key takeaway was the importance of understanding the underlying systems within a game engine. Initially, I tried to use Godot’s collision system without fully grasping how it works under the hood, leading to unnecessary frustration and wasted time. Once I took a step back to learn about the physics engine, tilemap integration, and how the engine handles collision shapes, I was able to solve the problem much more effectively. This experience reinforced the idea that taking time to fully understand the tools I’m working with often saves more time in the long run than rushing through implementation.</p>
							
						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							<h2>What I Might Do Differently</h2>
							<p>Looking back, I would have approached the problem with a more methodical plan from the start. I often dive into coding as soon as I have a rough idea of what I want to achieve, but this experience showed me the value of mapping out potential challenges and researching solutions beforehand. In future projects, I will invest more time in planning and prototyping before jumping into the implementation phase.</p>
							
						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							<h2>What I Learned About Myself as an Engineer</h2>
							<p>This project confirmed my belief that perseverance and iteration are crucial to problem-solving. There were several moments during the collision detection challenge where I could have taken a shortcut or simplified the problem by reducing the complexity of the maze or player interactions. Instead, I pushed myself to find a solution that preserved the integrity of the game’s design. I learned that I enjoy solving deeply technical problems, especially when it involves balancing user experience with technical efficiency.</p>
							
						</div>
						<div class="4u">

						<h2>Confirming and Questioning Beliefs</h2>
							<p>Before starting this project, I believed that solving technical challenges was primarily about writing clever code. Through this process, I’ve come to realize that good engineering is just as much about planning, problem-solving, and understanding the tools you're using. My previous approach was to jump straight into the code, but now I see the value in taking time to fully map out the problem, explore alternatives, and gather input from others before writing a single line of code.</p>
							
						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							<h2>How This Project Informs My Engineering Path in the Future</h2>
							<p>Moving forward, I want to focus more on creating structured development processes. I’ve seen the benefits of doing thorough research and planning before diving into code, and I plan to incorporate more formal steps like creating design documents and prototypes for future projects. Additionally, this project has solidified my interest in game development and highlighted the importance of balancing performance with gameplay experience.</p>
